Potential Harms from Malicious or Over-Permissive Extensions:

1. Privacy Invasion
   Extensions like "Microsoft Rewards" and "Hoxx VPN Proxy" can access "all browsing data", including:

   * Search queries
   * Cookies and login sessions
   * Content of visited pages
     A malicious actor could harvest this data for profiling, tracking, or sale to third parties.

2. Credential Theft
   With permission to read/change all site data (as in **Hoxx VPN Proxy**), an extension can:

   * Intercept usernames and passwords
   * Inject phishing content or redirect users to fake login pages

3. Session Hijacking & Browser Manipulation

   Extensions can:

   * Change browser settings (e.g., search engine redirection)
   * Auto-click ads or reward links ("click fraud", seen in Automate Your Bing Searches)
   * Run scripts to perform actions on your behalf

4. InPrivate Browsing Exploits
   Many of these extensions "retain access even in private mode", negating its purpose:

   * Your private browsing data can still be tracked and logged.

Recommendations

* Disable or Remove High-Risk Extensions

  * Consider removing "Hoxx VPN Proxy" unless you absolutely trust the source.
  * Be cautious with "Automate Your Bing Searches", especially if it’s from an unofficial source.

* Review Permissions

  * Avoid extensions that request access to **"all sites"** unless it's strictly necessary.
  * Prefer extensions that limit access to **specific domains**.

* Monitor Browser Behavior

  * Look out for:

    * Unusual redirects
    * Slower performance
    * Auto-searching or clicking behavior (especially in reward-oriented extensions)

* Use Developer Mode Only When Necessary

  * Keep "Developer Mode" off to prevent accidental loading of unverified extensions.
